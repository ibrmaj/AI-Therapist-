# AI-Therapist-


A simple AI-powered chatbot designed to provide conversational support and simulate a virtual therapist. This project uses **React** for the frontend and **Python (Flask)** for the backend, integrating natural language processing (NLP) to generate responses.

---

## **Features**
- Interactive chat interface for user conversations.
- Sentiment analysis for understanding user emotions.
- Contextual responses using basic NLP models.
- Clean and responsive design.

---

## **Tech Stack**
### **Frontend**:
- **React**: For building the user interface.

### **Backend**:
- **Flask**: For handling API requests and responses.
- **Python NLP Libraries**: TextBlob/spaCy for processing user input.
